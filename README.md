## First Steps - Obtain API Keys
* Before you are able to run the jupyter notebook files "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy" that are located inside the folder "WeatherPy" located on the main brach of this repository. You will need to obtain two API keys that are individual to your email address (these API keys that you obtain should be kept private and should only be known by you). The way to obtain the two API keys needed to run both the files metioned above is by going onto "https://www.geoapify.com/" and "https://openweathermap.org/api", and then creating a free account. You will then get an email from both of these websites saying to you need to activate your API keys and once that is completed, you will be able to use the API keys that they have provided for you.
